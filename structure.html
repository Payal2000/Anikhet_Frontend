        <p>A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consists of several convolutional layers, often paired with subsampling, and then transitions into one or more fully connected layers, similar to traditional multilayer neural networks.<br><br>

            CNNs are specifically designed to leverage the 2D nature of inputs like images or speech signals. They achieve this through localized connections and shared weights, paired with pooling methods, producing features that are invariant to translation.<br><br>
            
            One major advantage of CNNs is their reduced training complexity and fewer parameters compared to standard fully connected networks with equivalent hidden units.<br><br>
            
            This article delves into the structure of CNNs and the backpropagation method used to calculate the gradient concerning its parameters, facilitating gradient-based optimization. For a deeper understanding of specific processes like convolution and pooling, refer to the relevant tutorials.
