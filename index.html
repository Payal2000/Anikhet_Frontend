        <p>Since Aristotle's era, researchers have been attempting to understand neural activities using various models and analogies.<br>

           The Hodgkin-Huxley mathematical model, which describes the squid's giant axon, is among the most prominent in recent times.<br>

           This has paved the way for models that depict the behavior of individual neurons and systems containing thousands of cells.<br>

           While Harmon led the way in creating electronic replicas of neural circuits, they are not easy to handle.<br>

           Nonetheless, the most significant advancements in modern neural modeling have come from the use of both analog and digital computers [6].</p>
